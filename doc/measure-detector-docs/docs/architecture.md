# Architectural Overview

## JHipster

## Data Model

The datamodel can be generated for the corresponding JDL file which is located in the /jdl folder on the top level. 

Further information can be found at the official documentation: [JDL Documentation](http://easynode.github.io/jdl/)

in order to generate new entities just modify the jdl file and call

    $ jhipster jdl ./jdl/jdl.jh

The output should be something like this:
